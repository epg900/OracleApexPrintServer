in the report printing tab in the print server combo box select External(Apache FOP)

then set Print Server Host Address to your PHP server address like localhost
set Port to 80 
and set Print Server Script to your PHP script like /print.php


then enter the shell (in Windows like cmd / in Linux like bash)

enter the sqlplus as sysdba:
